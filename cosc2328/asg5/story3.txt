STORY OF A FIERCE BAD RABBIT by Beatrix Potter

This is a fierce bad Rabbit;
look at his savage whiskers and his claws and his turned-up tail.
This is a nice gentle Rabbit.  His mother has given him a carrot.
The bad Rabbit would like some carrot.
He doesn't say "Please."  He takes it!
And he scratches the good Rabbit very badly.
The good Rabbit creeps away and hides in a hole.  It feels sad.
